# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
This application serves as a functional back end for an e-commerce site. It consists of a working Express.js API that utilizes Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. By creating this application I was able to further enhance my back-end developing skills along with my understanding of Sequelize, MySQL and Express.js. 

## Installation
To use this application, you will need to install all dependencies by running "npm install" in the project's terminal. You will also need to install MySQL. Refer here for MySQL installation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/

## Usage 
Before using the application, create a .env file. In this you will store your MySQL credentials, and then utilize the file to ensure MySQL Server connection. To start the application, install all dependencies as listed above and then run "npm start" in the terminal. You can test the application by using an app like Insomnia.
